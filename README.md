#Race Car

## My Idea
I am going to have a canvas that takes up the majority of the web page. Inside of the canvas there would be an image of race car field, like a board game. The board game would have a specific path for the car to go. Also in the canvas would be my div that would represent the car.

###Objective:
Objective of the game is to be able to move the car across the board game using the buttons(Left,Up, Down & Right) on the screen in 60 seconds. Also you can use the navigational keys on the keyboard. 

###Additional Stuff: 
	1. Have a timer that counts down
	2. making it look pretty
    3. use the keyboard keys
	

## Obstacles
The Javascript part

1. Making the buttons (Up, Down, Right, Left)
2. connecting the buttons to the car
3. a start button that connects to the timer counting down
4. I wasn't able to create an if statement for boundaries of the div so that the car doesn't past the div container or the maze
